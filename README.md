Hello community,

Thanks that you want to report and contribute for Exorsium Realm!

Some quick informations about using the Bugtracker:

    The issuetracker is for serverside and gamemechanic issues only. If you have any trouble with your character or your account (Missing rewards or login problems), please write an Ingame-issue to a Gamemaster and the Gamemaster will then help you as soon as he can. (Create a new account if you cannot login with your old account due to login problems).

    Your issue will be reviewed by testers and the developers will fix it in the future.

    Only once the issue got the label GitHub Logo you can find the fix on your Gameserver.

    You can increase the relevance of your issue by adding a thumb-up emote

    Please Clear your cache ("WDB") folder of your game client before reporting any issue.
